To determine the role of Ser-352 in the allosteric response, the thrA gene was modified by using site-directed mutagenesis so that Ser-352 of the wild-type AKI-HDI was replaced by Ala, Arg, Asn, Gln, Glu, His, Leu, Met, Pro, Thr, Trp, Tyr, or Val.

The technique of microcomplement fixation was employed to probe for conformational alterations elicited by binding of substrates (phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and adenosine diphosphate), the allosteric activator (fructose 1,6-diphosphate), and the inhibitor (valine). On binding of PEP and valine to pyruvate kinase a pronounced reduction in the extent of complement fixation was observed. The second substrate, ADP, had no effect while FDP elicited a moderate suppression of complement fixation. These results suggest that as a consequence of conformational changes induced by PEP and valine, some antigenic determinants on the surface of pyruvate kinase ...</td>\n",

The developmental pattern follows that of catalase, a marker enzyme for gluconeogenesis in this tissue. 2. The enzyme at its peak of development was partially purified, and its properties were studied. It has an optimal activity at neutral pH (7.0-8.0). The apparent Km value for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is 3.8 X 10(-5) M. The activity is inhibited by AMP allosterically with an apparent Ki value of 2.2 X 10(-4) M. The enzyme hydrolyses fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and not ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate or sedoehptulose 1,7-bisphosphate. 3.

       "1   Aspartokinase I and homoserine dehydrogenase I (AKI-HDI) from Serratia marcescens Sr41 are encoded by the thrA gene as a single polypeptide chain. Previously, a single amino acid substitution of Ser-352 with Phe was shown to produce an AKI-HDI enzyme that is not subject to threonine-mediated feedback inhibition. To determine the role of Ser-352 in the allosteric response, the thrA gene was modified by using site-directed mutagenesis so that Ser-352 of the wild-type AKI-HDI was replaced by Ala, Arg, Asn, Gln, Glu, His, Leu, Met, Pro, Thr, Trp, Tyr, or Val. The Thr-352 and Pro-352 replacements rendered AKIs sensitive to threonine. The Tyr-352 and Asn-352 substitutions led to activation, rather than inhibition, of AKI by threonine. The other replacements conferred threonine insensitivity ...   \n",
       "2   Novel antimicrobial targets are urgently needed to overcome rising antibiotic resistance of important human pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Here we report the essentiality and kinetic properties of MRSA pyruvate kinase (PK). Targetron-mediated gene disruption demonstrated PK is essential for S. aureus growth and survival, suggesting that this protein may be a potential drug target. The presence of the pfk (6-phosphofructokinase)-pyk operon in MRSA252, and the nonessential nature of PFK shown by targetron, further emphasized the essential role of PK in cell viability. The importance of PK in bacterial growth was confirmed by showing that its enzymatic activity peaked during the logarithmic phase of S. aureus growth. PK from Staphylococcus and seve...   \n",
       "3   Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes both acute tuberculosis and latent, symptom-free infection that affects roughly one-third of the world's population. It is a globally important pathogen that poses multiple dangers. Mtb reprograms its metabolism in response to the host niche, and this adaptation contributes to its pathogenicity. Knowledge of the metabolic regulation mechanisms in Mtb is still limited. Pyruvate kinase, involved in the late stage of glycolysis, helps link various metabolic routes together. Here, we demonstrate that Mtb pyruvate kinase (Mtb PYK) predominantly catalyzes the reaction leading to the production of pyruvate, but its activity is influenced by multiple metabolites from closely interlinked pathways that act as allosteric regulators (activators and inhibitor...   \n",

       "6   The pyruvate kinase (PK) from a moderate thermophile, Geobacillus stearothermophilus, is an allosteric enzyme activated by AMP and ribose 5-phosphate but not fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP), which is a common activator of PKs. It has an extra C-terminal sequence (ECTS), which contains a highly conserved phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) binding motif, but its function and structure remain unclear. To elucidate the structural characteristics of the effector-binding site and the ECTS, the crystal structure of the C9S/C268S mutant of the enzyme was determined at 2.4 A resolution. The crystal belonged to space group P6(2)22, with unit cell parameters a, b = 145.97 A, c = 118.03 A.

       "9   Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) was isolated from Neurospora crassa mycelium grown at 28 degrees C (PK-28) and at 42 degrees C (PK-42).

PK-28 showed an activation by FDP but PK-42, under comparable conditions, appeared to be activated by low concentrations of FDP and inhibited by higher ones. For PK-28, complex formation with FDP results in a lowering of the isoelectric point from 6.40 to 5.50, representing the pI of the unliganded enzyme and that of the complex, respectively. In contrast to this, PK-42 exhibits a weak binding to FDP as suggested by a lack of decrease in the isoelectric point on treatment with comparable concentrations of ...   \n",

       "11  Antibodies against pyruvate kinase of Neurospora crassa, induced in rabbits, were used to monitor the interaction of ligands with this enzyme. The technique of microcomplement fixation was employed to probe for conformational alterations elicited by binding of substrates (phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and adenosine diphosphate), the allosteric activator (fructose 1,6-diphosphate), and the inhibitor (valine). On binding of PEP and valine to pyruvate kinase a pronounced reduction in the extent of complement fixation was observed. The second substrate, ADP, had no effect while FDP elicited a moderate suppression of complement fixation. These results suggest that as a consequence of conformational changes induced by PEP and valine, some antigenic determinants on the surface of pyruvate kinase ...   \n",

The renaturation of Neurospora pyruvate kinase following denaturation with urea was investigated. 2. The substrates, phosphoenol pyruvate and adenosine diphosphate, were observed to stabilize the enzyme against urea-induced structural disorganization. 3. It was demonstrated that for refolding/reactivation of the denatured protein the allosteric activator, fructose-1,6-diphosphate and a sulphydryl protectant are required. 4. The enzyme recovered following renaturation showed complete immunological identity with the native enzyme in Ouchterlony double diffusion tests.   \n",
       "13  We have cloned the hexokinase [E.C. 2.7.1.1] gene of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoite and obtained an active recombinant enzyme with a calculated molecular mass of 51,465Da and an isoelectric point of 5.82. Southern blot analysis indicated that the hexokinase gene existed as a single copy in the tachyzoites of T. gondii. The sequence of T. gondii hexokinase exhibited the highest identity (44%) to that of Plasmodium falciparum hexokinase and lower identity of less than 35% to those of hexokinases from other organisms. The specific activity of the homogeneously purified recombinant enzyme was 4.04 micromol/mg protein/min at 37 degrees C under optimal conditions. The enzyme could use glucose, fructose, and mannose as substrates, though it preferred glucose. Adenosine triphosphate was exclusiv...   \n",
       "14  Mammalian hexokinase type I is a 100 kDa enzyme that has been considered to be evolved from an ancestral 50 kDa yeast-type hexokinase, insensitive to product inhibition, by gene duplication and fusion. According to this model, and based on many experimental data, the catalytic site is associated with the C-terminal half of the enzyme, although an allosteric site for the binding of glucose 6-phosphate could be present on the N-terminal half of the molecule. We have isolated a cDNA clone of hexokinase from a lambda gt11 human placenta library comprising 2658 bp, containing a single open reading frame of 1893 nucleotides, which encodes a truncate form of hexokinase starting from asparagine-287 to the terminal serine-917. This clone was further digested with restriction enzyme NcoI to obta...   \n",
       "15  Hexokinase I governs the rate-limiting step of glycolysis in brain tissue, being inhibited by its product, glucose 6-phosphate, and allosterically relieved of product inhibition by phosphate. On the basis of small-angle X-ray scattering, the wild-type enzyme is a monomer in the presence of glucose and phosphate at protein concentrations up to 10 mg/mL, but in the presence of glucose 6-phosphate, is a dimer down to protein concentrations as low as 1 mg/mL. A mutant form of hexokinase I, specifically engineered by directed mutation to block dimerization, remains monomeric at high protein concentration under all conditions of ligation. This nondimerizing mutant exhibits wild-type activity, potent inhibition by glucose 6-phosphate, and phosphate reversal of product inhibition. Small-angle ...   \n",
