Novel antimicrobial targets are urgently needed to overcome rising antibiotic resistance of important human pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Here we report the essentiality and kinetic properties of MRSA pyruvate kinase (PK). Targetron-mediated gene disruption demonstrated PK is essential for S. aureus growth and survival, suggesting that this protein may be a potential drug target. The presence of the pfk (6-phosphofructokinase)-pyk operon in MRSA252, and the nonessential nature of PFK shown by targetron, further emphasized the essential role of PK in cell viability. The importance of PK in bacterial growth was confirmed by showing that its enzymatic activity peaked during the logarithmic phase of S. aureus growth. PK from Staphylococcus and several other species of bacteria have an extra C-terminal domain (CT) containing a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) binding motif. To elucidate the possible structure and function of this sequence, the quaternary structures and kinetic properties of the full-length MRSA PK and truncated MRSA PK lacking the CT domain were characterized. Our results showed that (1) MRSA PK is an allosteric enzyme with homotetramer architecture activated by AMP or ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), but not by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), which suggests a different mode of allosteric regulation when compared with human isozymes, (2) the CT domain is not required for the tetramerization of the enzyme; homotetramerization occurred in a truncated PK lacking the domain, (3) truncated enzyme exhibited high affinity toward both PEP and ADP and exhibited hyperbolic kinetics toward PEP in the presence of activators (AMP and R5P) consistent with kinetic properties of full-length enzyme, indicating that the CT domain is not required for substrate binding or allosteric regulation observed in the holoenzyme, (4) the kinetic efficiency (k(cat)/S(0.5)) of truncated enzyme was decreased by 24- and 16-fold, in ligand-free state, toward PEP and ADP, respectively, but was restored by 3-fold in AMP-bound state, suggesting that the sequence containing the CT domain (Gly(473)-Leu(585)) plays a substantial role in enzyme activity and comformational stability, and (5) full-length MRSA PK activity was stimulated at low concentrations of ATP (e.g., 1 mM) and inhibited by inorganic phosphate and high concentrations of FBP (10 mM) and ATP (e.g., >2.5 mM), whereas for truncated enzyme, stimulation at low concentrations of ATP was lost. These findings suggest that the CT domain is involved in maintaining the specificity of allosteric regulation of MRSA PK by AMP, R5P, and ATP. The CT extension also encodes a protein domain with homology to enzyme I of the Escherichia coli sugar-PTS system, suggesting that MRSA PK may also exert an important regulatory role in sugar transport metabolism. These findings yield new insights into MRSA PK function and mode of allosteric regulation which may aid in the development of clinically important drugs targeting this enzyme and further define the role of the extra C-terminal domain in modulating the enzyme's activity.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes both acute tuberculosis and latent, symptom-free infection that affects roughly one-third of the world's population. It is a globally important pathogen that poses multiple dangers. Mtb reprograms its metabolism in response to the host niche, and this adaptation contributes to its pathogenicity. Knowledge of the metabolic regulation mechanisms in Mtb is still limited. Pyruvate kinase, involved in the late stage of glycolysis, helps link various metabolic routes together. Here, we demonstrate that Mtb pyruvate kinase (Mtb PYK) predominantly catalyzes the reaction leading to the production of pyruvate, but its activity is influenced by multiple metabolites from closely interlinked pathways that act as allosteric regulators (activators and inhibitors). We identified allosteric activators and inhibitors of Mtb PYK originating from glycolysis, citrate cycle, nucleotide/nucleoside inter-conversion related pathways that had not been described so far. Enzyme was found to be activated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, adenine, adenosine, hypoxanthine, inosine, L-2-phosphoglycerate, l-aspartate, glycerol-2-phosphate, glycerol-3-phosphate. On the other hand thiamine pyrophosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and L-malate were identified as inhibitors of Mtb PYK. The detailed kinetic analysis indicated a morpheein model of Mtb PYK allosteric control which is strictly dependent on Mg<sup>2+</sup> and substantially increased by the co-presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>.

The genes for the pyruvate kinases of a psychrophile, Bacillus psychrophilus, and a mesophile, Bacillus licheniformis, have been cloned in Escherichia coli, and all their nucleotides were sequenced. The two bacterial enzymes each had an extra C-terminal sequence consisting of about 110 amino acid residues, which has been found in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme. Both enzymes were overexpressed in E. coli and the properties of the purified enzymes were compared to those of the B. stearothermophilus enzyme. Both enzymes were less stable than the B. stearothermophilus one. The B. psychrophilus enzyme was more stable than the B. licheniformis one. Similarly to the B. licheniformis and B. stearothermophilus pyruvate kinases, the B. psychrophilus enzyme was activated by AMP or ribose 5-phosphate, and inhibited by ATP or fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Thus, these enzymes were very similar in the sigmoidal saturation curve for phosphoenolpyruvate and allosteric effectors, but their optimum temperatures and thermostabilities were very different.

PCC 6803. Annotated genomes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 were analyzed for the respective predicted physical properties of each enzyme investigated here. Enzymatic activity was largely unaffected by nutritional mode, with the exception of glucokinase and PK whose activities were significantly elevated in heterotrophic cultures of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. PFK activity was insensitive to bacterial PFK-A (allosteric) effectors such as PEP, implying that Synechocystis PFK should be classified as a PFK-B (non-allosteric). Immunoblot and kinetic studies indicated that irrespective of nutritional mode, the Synechocystis PK corresponds to a PK-A (AMP activated) rather than PK-F (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate activated).

Pyruvate kinases (PK, EC 2.7.1.40) from three hyperthermophilic archaea (Archaeoglobus fulgidus strain 7324, Aeropyrum pernix, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum) and from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima were compared with respect to their thermophilic, kinetic, and regulatory properties. PKs from the archaea are 200-kDa homotetramers composed of 50-kDa subunits. The enzymes required divalent cations, Mg2+ and Mn2+ being most effective, but were independent of K+. Temperature optima for activity were 85 degrees C (A. fulgidus) and above 98 degrees C (A. pernix and P. aerophilum). The PKs were highly thermostable up to 110 degrees C (A. pernix) and showed melting temperatures for thermal unfolding at 93 degrees C (A. fulgidus) or above 98 degrees C (A. pernix and P. aerophilum). All archaeal PKs exhibited sigmoidal saturation kinetics with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP indicating positive homotropic cooperative response with both substrates. Classic heterotropic allosteric regulators of PKs from eukarya and bacteria, e.g. fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or AMP, did not affect PK activity of hyperthermophilic archaea, suggesting the absence of heterotropic allosteric regulation. PK from the bacterium T. maritima is also a homotetramer of 50-kDa subunits. The enzyme was independent of K+ ions, had a temperature optimum of 80 degrees C, was highly thermostable up to 90 degrees C, and had a melting temperature above 98 degrees C. The enzyme showed cooperative response to PEP and ADP. In contrast to its archaeal counterparts, the T. maritima enzyme exhibited the classic allosteric response to the activator AMP and to the inhibitor ATP. Sequences of hyperthermophilic PKs showed significant similarity to characterized PKs from bacteria and eukarya. Phylogenetic analysis of PK sequences of all three domains indicates a distinct archaeal cluster that includes the PK from the hyperthermophilic bacterium T. maritima.

Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) was isolated from Neurospora crassa mycelium grown at 28 degrees C (PK-28) and at 42 degrees C (PK-42). The regulatory properties, particularly the response towards the allosteric effector fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP), was different in the two enzymes. PK-28 showed an activation by FDP but PK-42, under comparable conditions, appeared to be activated by low concentrations of FDP and inhibited by higher ones. For PK-28, complex formation with FDP results in a lowering of the isoelectric point from 6.40 to 5.50, representing the pI of the unliganded enzyme and that of the complex, respectively. In contrast to this, PK-42 exhibits a weak binding to FDP as suggested by a lack of decrease in the isoelectric point on treatment with comparable concentrations of FDP. Studies with quenching of aromatic residue fluorescence of PK-28 and PK-42, following binding of FDP, indicate that although this ligand binds to both types of enzymes the affinity for the two is vastly different. Dissociation constants of 9.3 muM and 0.1 mM were calculated for the binding of FDP to PK-28 and PK-42, respectively. It is concluded that growth at elevated temperatures induced a conformational change in the pyruvate kinase leading to partial desensitization of the allosteric site. The nature of the factor(s) responsible for this change is not understood at present.	Canadian journal of biochemistry	1976	None	10.1139/o76-058

Pyruvate kinase isolated from Neurospora and purified to homogeneity has been shown to be a tetramer of molecular weight around 242 000 by gel filtration studies and 239 000 daltons by sedimentation equilibrium measurements. The monomer produced by treatment with guanidine hydrochloride is found to be 51 000-52 000 daltons by sedimentation equilibrium studies; a molecular weight of 62 000 was determined for the monomer generated by SDS treatment by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The enzyme has an isoelectric point of 6.35-6.41; Substrate saturation kinetics of PEP show a variable extent of cooperativity depending upon the buffer ions employed in the assay. ADP is the most effective phosphoryl group acceptor, GDP and IDP being poor substitutes. A divalent cation, Mg-2+, is required for activity. At low concentrations, Ca-2+ acts as an activator of pyruvate kinase but it is inhibitory at high concentrations. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate is the most potent allosteric activator, fructose 6-phosphate being next in order of effectiveness. Valine is a powerful inhibitor. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan are without any effect individually, but their simultaneous presence results in a considerable activation. Alanine does not affect this enzyme appreciably.

Antibodies against pyruvate kinase of Neurospora crassa, induced in rabbits, were used to monitor the interaction of ligands with this enzyme. The technique of microcomplement fixation was employed to probe for conformational alterations elicited by binding of substrates (phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and adenosine diphosphate), the allosteric activator (fructose 1,6-diphosphate), and the inhibitor (valine). On binding of PEP and valine to pyruvate kinase a pronounced reduction in the extent of complement fixation was observed. The second substrate, ADP, had no effect while FDP elicited a moderate suppression of complement fixation. These results suggest that as a consequence of conformational changes induced by PEP and valine, some antigenic determinants on the surface of pyruvate kinase are rendered inaccessible to the antibodies.

The sequence of T. gondii hexokinase exhibited the highest identity (44%) to that of Plasmodium falciparum hexokinase and lower identity of less than 35% to those of hexokinases from other organisms. The specific activity of the homogeneously purified recombinant enzyme was 4.04 micromol/mg protein/min at 37 degrees C under optimal conditions. The enzyme could use glucose, fructose, and mannose as substrates, though it preferred glucose. Adenosine triphosphate was exclusively the most effective phosphorus donor, and pyrophosphate did not serve as a substrate. K(m) values for glucose and adenosine triphosphate were 8.0+/-0.8 microM and 1.05+/-0.25mM, respectively. No allosteric effect of substrates was observed, and the products, glucose 6-phosphate and adenosine diphosphate, had no inhibitory effect on T. gondii hexokinase activity. Other phosphorylated hexoses, fructose 6-phosphate, trehalose 6-phosphate which is an inhibitor of yeast hexokinase, and pyrophosphate, also did not affect T. gondii hexokinase activity. Native hexokinase activity was recovered in both the cytosol and membrane fractions of the whole lysate of T. gondii tachyzoites. This result suggests that T. gondii hexokinase weakly associates with the membrane or particulate fraction of the tachyzoite cell.
